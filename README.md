# remind-bot
## Motivation
Sometimes we tend to forget something when we focus too much on something else. For example, we might forget to attend a class because we are too focused on coding, or we might forget about a sale on an online shopping mall. To solve these problems, I created this remind bot.

The principle is simple - input the URL and the date/time, click "add time", and you're done.
